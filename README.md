# Language-Learning-Academy
Reinout De Bleser made this.

We promise the readme is fun to read. We have a coding joke at the end. 

We simply made the README to explain our project. 

Our project is simple, for our course in BeCode we had to make our first business website in team. 
The website is for a school for language learning and contains:
-an Index page 
-a Courses page, 
-an About page, 
-a Contact page 
and a Team page. 

The repo on GitHub contains: 
-img folder
-styles folder
-pages folder
index.html
FFA-checklist: mainly to review progress and divide tasks. 

Our teammembers consist of Stefan, Neha, Xiaoqi, Binayak and Reinout

The readme is fun to read! 

The readme looks good!

The readme is clear even though the monkey has no idea what is going on.

Joke:
How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
None – It’s a hardware problem
