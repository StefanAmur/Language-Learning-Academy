## Project

>Our project is simple, for our course in BeCode we had to make our first business website in a team.      
> We had 4 days to complete it   
> The website is for a school that offers courses on foreign languages  

## Learning objectives
- ✔learn to work in a group  
- ✔learn to complete a project so it can be delivered to a client

## The mission
- ✔Invent a company together and think of 1 page per person in your team, that the company needs
- ✔Divide those pages amongst the group and each person designs one page.
- ✔Once you are all finished, join those pages together with some form of navigation
- ✔Publish the result with a github repository (call it name-of-your-business)
- ✔Make sure everyone in the group has a fork of the website
- ✔Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company'website' in there
- ✔Add a parallax image header
- ✔Add a carousel on one page
- ✔Make your website responsive
- ✔Mention your phone number somewhere on the onepager, in the a tag add tel in the href.
- ✔Have a contact form, add a fake email in the mailto property.
